# Tableau-Work
Images of dashboards I designed in Tableau. The asset engine and contract length dashboards can be viewed here (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ian.young/viz/LengthofContractReportxAssetEngine/ContractLength). The asset engine displays the percent contribution of assets that positively impacted the KPI. These numbers were dervied from variable importance scores that were calculated using logisitic regression, computed using tidyverse/tidymodels and nested models.
